WHAT'S WORKING RIGHT NOW:

Admin login at http://localhost:3000/admin/login
Admin dashboard at http://localhost:3000/admin/dashboard with real class data
Classes management at http://localhost:3000/admin/classes showing all classes
Backend APIs for all class operations tested and working
Database with complete class structure and sample data
Search/filter functionality on classes page

TECHNICAL STATUS:

Backend: All class-based APIs implemented and tested
Frontend: Admin login, dashboard, and classes page complete
Database: Migrated to class-based schema with seed data
Authentication: Admin system fully working with permissions

NEXT DEVELOPER TASK:
Build the Class Detail Page (/admin/classes/[id]/page.tsx) where admins can:

View complete class information (students, subjects, teachers)
Manage individual students in the class
Assign/reassign class teacher
Add/remove subjects for the class
View class performance analytics

All backend APIs are ready - the class detail controller (getClassDetails) returns complete class data with students, subjects, and teachers.
